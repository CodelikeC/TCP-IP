# In windows
- Using Windows API and open SSL to initialize your insights of coding protocols, TCP/IP are likely to be used for creating a safe "tools" and relevant to email, messages...

# Improvements of Client:
✅ Uses WinSock2 instead of POSIX sockets.
✅ Implements AES-GCM encryption via OpenSSL for security.
✅ Uses nonce-based authentication to prevent spoofing.
✅ Properly handles Windows socket initialization (WSAStartup).
✅ Supports IPv4 and IPv6 discovery.

# Improvement of Server: 
✅ Uses WinSock2 for Windows-based socket programming.
✅ Implements TLS encryption via OpenSSL (TLS 1.2/1.3).
✅ Uses AES-GCM for authenticated encryption.
✅ Supports IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
✅ Properly initializes and cleans up WSA and OpenSSL.
